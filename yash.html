<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I, I didn't even know I had equity in the company. I'm going to be really honest. I just took the job because I thought it was a great opportunity to learn.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Welcome to the First Hire Podcast where on every episode broadcast, I'll be talking to the first hires of successful tech empires, discovering previously untold tales of fails and how a startup scales, digging into the who, the why, the how, and finding out what they're up to now.</p>
<p> Our guest today is Yash Nelapati, the first hire of Pinterest, which is currently valued at over $25 billion on the New York Stock Exchange, and now—spoiler alert—co-founder and CTO of MakersPlace, the NFT platform which sold the most expensive NFT to date. We get into some interesting topics from initial career failure to helping both Shakira and an auction house founded in 1766 to navigate the world of crypto. So it may get a tad into the weeds towards the end, but don't worry, I had to Google stuff too and there's super high quality transcripts at firsthirepodcast.com/yash. So that's first hire podcast, all spelled out in words, and then Y A S H for Yash. But for now let's just kick things off.</p>
<p>Hey, Yash, welcome to the show. Thanks for coming on and being the first guest.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Thank you, Oisín. Happy to be here. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> We should probably just dive straight into starting at the start.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I was born in south India, a town called Vijayawada pretty close to Hyderabad. I was born in 85. I did my schooling and my undergrad there. My dad's an engineer. My mom's a doctor. And looking at my mom's routine, I chose not to become a doctor because it's so hard. She works extremely hard and stuff.</p>
<p>But I was always fascinated by my dad's job. He's a metallurgical engineer. So as a kid, I saw molten metal just being cast into a die and just like machining it, polishing it and stuff. So I was like, all right. I was decided that I was going to become a metallurgical engineer. But my dad forced me into computer science just because I guess he saw the future and the vision and the possibilities.</p>
<p>I absolutely hated it. So I forced myself, for four years to just get through the program. Played a lot of sports for the university and stuff. I guess at the end of my bachelor's, I had a degree, I had good grades, just no knowledge I would say, pretty poor basics. A lot of my friends were leaving to the dreamland America.</p>
<p>I just took a six month break to figure out what I want to do. I was fascinated with movies and movie making. So I took time to learn some skills. I did some courses and worked part-time for a movie crew. And then I guess I decided like, all right, this might not be me after all. So I just took a leap of faith and followed most of my friends who came here. I came to San Jose state.</p>
<p>I guess the true story was like, I also pursued a girl. So that's also part of why I came here. So that hence the Silicon valley I guess I got lucky, but yeah, so I came to San Jose state, which was pretty much my only option because she was here and then soon after I realized, all right, I guess I'm gonna hone my computer skills and really do something out of this because I'm going to graduate in two years, I need to figure out this thing called life.</p>
<p>So I guess I worked extremely hard those two years because my basics were poor. I didn't do an internship because I knew that if I just take up a testing internship that might define my career and I might just have to stay in that field. So I I was the only student who did not do an internship for them type of years. And that was a bad choice. Out of school I didn't have a job. And the recession hit in 2009 and then I was forced to do some contracting and some freelancing and stuff while my friends were already settling in bigger companies. That forced me towards startups because I guess the big companies always look for experience and stuff.</p>
<p>So that was my foray into startups. I used to respond to a lot of Craigslist ads pick up gigs and start working. That's how I ended up on my first opportunity at Symantec, which didn't last long. Again, this team was extremely more progressed and well experienced and I just did not make a good fit in the team.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah. I'd love to dive into that. So I'd love to dive into that a bit more. First of all, what made you realize the movie business wasn't for you?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I just didn't have a proper degree or proper experience. So I knew okay, I need to spend five years to even become a decent technical person, or even something like a writer, like it needs a lot of time and I don't know if I was willing to put in that amount of time.</p>
<p>And like I told you, also at the time I might lose this girl or I might have to pursue this I just like, ah, this just ugh, the choices are tough, but I always had an eye for it. So I was like, maybe I'll just do my masters and see if there's a way to get into LA and Dreamworks and all which I did look into it.</p>
<p>I got an internship at Glendale in Disney and I just did not pursue it again. I just didn't have the basics and it's going to be a longer journey. So I'm like, all right. But I always had this fine intersection between my skillset, which is computer software engineering and movie making or storytelling.</p>
<p>Looking back, I always found products that are in an intersection between storytelling and my skillset. So I think that was what I looked for in a product.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And you've always been interested in photography as well </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yes. Yeah, it's I guess it's all like a natural extension for me. I like cameras. I like shooting light. I read a lot. I look at a lot of YouTubes about cinematography and stuff. And I dunno, I guess the Pinterest founder Ben also says &quot;Hey, I think you were different because you just had an eye for storytelling and you would know what a good design is.&quot; and I guess that's why they gravitated towards me, but I guess that's coming in the story, so. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> So you graduate 2009, you graduate from the master's in software engineering, you spend, what is it? Six months looking for a job doing </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Almost a year</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, okay. Doing like 20, 30 interviews, and I think you said some of them are humiliating and then others, they just fell through because the company disappeared </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> the housing crisis, but then yeah, you eventually land Symantec and from your blog </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> fired in two months, but </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> yeah, it seems like, when you got that, that was like the kind of the prize possession you were like, okay.</p>
<p>And at the end of your blog, you're saying, I think the quote is about this Symantec job. You're saying it's all about being in the right place at the right time doing the right things. I mean, that's certainly true and this is the whole story, but that was maybe premature, but how did you fail at that job do you think?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> As I said, I think out of school, I just did not have experience to work with the team. So most, it was a great eye-opener for me when I started. The manager was extremely supportive, but I just knew the level of output all my coworkers were delivering was so high and I could tell, I was working extremely hard, but I was nowhere to be in that team. I just don't know why he even landed there. But it was like yeah, it was a good experience. I almost had tears leaving the office when I knew Okay. I mean, it was, it was coming, you know, like they asked me to stop committing code and that, that it was like, they, it was like a big red flame, like, alright, it's going down. And then I left and then, yeah. And then I was like, all right, I need to really work hard and stuff, but there was no opportunity. So I was doing a lot of these gigs and I went to one of these meetups in Palo Alto. FriendFeed was sold to Facebook. Uh, Bret Taylor was giving a talk about a non-blocking ISL called Tornado. When they open sourced it I literally read the source code multiple times and I was trying to understand what was going on and why it was non-blocking and how it is non-blocking and stuff. So I was well-prepared. So I went there and I asked him a ton of questions, very in-depth and very precise.</p>
<p>And the Pinterest founders were there and they were like, all right! They were there for the hiring reasons and they got their eyes on me. But I wasn't really interested because I was working at another startup called Design Reactor, which was a design shop. I used to just do my work in two hours and I used to spend six hours in the office just doing a lot of open source and learning. I was always learning and I was pretty happy. Like, all right, it didn't pay me a lot, but I'm learning and I think I'm on to something there. But Ben pursued me super hard, he was calling me every day for 30 days in 2009 December and somehow I was like &quot;all right, I think this might be something&quot;.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah. So is it true that his first pitch to you of the idea was a corkboard pinned with insects?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> It is! He literally held it up and he showed me. As a kid, he collected the insects and he's a very visual person and his design aesthetics and how technology should intersect with design was very visual, and that was literally the pitch, that's really true. And I went to a very very very shady office where I was like &quot;Holy crap there's only one window, it's so dark, oh, there's no restroom here. Okay. That's funny.&quot; and I wasn't sure. I wasn't convinced. And I guess I didn't know how to say no, so I was just like, &quot;all right, I'm just not going to respond for a while&quot;.</p>
<p>But he kept calling. He kept calling. He kept calling and then I was like, &quot;okay, I guess I'll take a leap of faith and join&quot;. And I started in that office and then we moved to an apartment where one of the co-founders was living and slowly started making progress. My dad used to call like, Hey, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Do you need any money? Blah, blah, blah. Like, no, I'm doing good. I got this job like, oh, what is it? I'm like, oh, I just work out of an apartment for a friend. It's like, okay </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Put it putting pinned insects on the internet.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, things weren't great, but you know, whatever I was learning for those last six months, Django everything I was putting all those ideas into implementation. There was no one to coach me, no one to give feedback, but hell yeah, I was having so much fun. Like just, just pushing stuff. I used to read something on hacker news, like, oh, there's this great database. I'm like, all right, I'm just going to deploy then see if it really does any of that. And I learned a lot, like, all right, you shouldn't just use these technologies that show up over the weekend because someone wants to write some code. But yeah, it was a great learning experience. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, so that was 2010 ish and I think before you joined Ben just raised and I suppose Ben and Evan, would it have been at that time? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> And Paul was another co-founder too. yeah. Yeah, they re so basically they had money leftover from the previous company called tote, which was also Pinterest, but it's slightly different product design. So that's how we got started with that leftover money. Had to file an H1B because I needed a visa out of school.</p>
<p>Luckily they just did all the paperwork. We had very little money, but the immigration lawyer was like, no worries. We'll get it done. And they got it done. I got it. And yeah, that's it like the slowly end of 2010, the site was growing, we could tell the traffic was coming in.</p>
<p>So it was me and another engineer, Marty, who was doing a lot of on-call rotation. The site was going down everyday of the week and then we just try to keep it up. Slowly we started hiring, scaling the product, scaling the service and I guess, yeah, the rest is history. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And for the hires after you? I think is it number two was from a Craigslist ad and number three was from</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah, that was Marty. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Hacker news. Okay, nice. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah. I think everyone was a great individual. Everyone had unique skills. More importantly, everyone was hungry and willing to work hard and make something out of it. But Yeah I always tell Ben we got extremely lucky in picking individuals at least the first 15, 20 folks. And it was a great team.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And I think around then, hiring more and getting that v    isa you close a round with I think that's Bessemer Venture Partners were the lead. I think <a href="https://www.bvp.com/anti-portfolio" target="_blank">their anti portfolio</a>, have you seen that? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I haven't </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, it's one of my favorite pages on the internet. It's basically just describing all the companies they missed out on, and exactly how. I think their one for Google is particularly good. I think they were in the house where Larry and Sergey were in the garage and whichever partner, was just asking how to get out of the house without going anywhere near the garage, just because he knew there were, some Stanford grads in there.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Oh, I didn't notice that, but yeah. Bessemer invested in 2011, Jeremy Levine got on board, Sarah Tavel who's at Benchmark right now used to work with Jeremy Levine then. Later she quit and joined Pinterest as a PM. But yeah, it's a great set of people. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> So yeah, around like the, what is the end of 2011 you've raised. 40 million total by that point, have something like over 6 million uniques </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah. The site was definitely blowing up. There was just a ton of crazy. The average session time was much higher than Reddit or anything they saw at that point of time. We raised money from Andreessen. We hired faster and we leveraged AWS as much as we could. And we tried to keep the service up, but AWS back in the day was there was no SSDs. There was no amazing services so you kind of had to build everything. They just give you some metal to run on. So a lot of fun and interesting problems that you had to solve at scale at that point of time. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> With this massive scale and excellent growth and all that, how many tests did you written at this point?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Hahaha. We just didn't have any tests at that point of time. I remember Tracy Chou who was also an early engineer giving a talk in Stanford and yeah, she mentioned it. We had zero tests and probably thousands of lines of code. And it was always like more manual testing, which wasn't good, but I just didn't have the test driven development experience. And also like, we were just focused on building the product. So we were just doing things extremely faster, learning iterating. So we kept that product loop pretty tight. And I was the only engineer for a year, so not a whole lot of time to write tests and stuff. So just push, push, push, learn, fix things on fire.</p>
<p>That was always the attitude, but I guess somewhere around 15 months, so probably mid 2011, we started putting a whole lot of emphasis on tests, coverage and everything. And then we started writing tests. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> It's great to hear that you can get to such scale without writing tests.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah. A little bit of luck, but yeah, a lot of manual testing. The founder, Paul and everyone is testing a lot of stuff manually, but yeah, not proud story, but it is what it is, so yeah. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Would you do it any differently doing it again?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I am doing it differently, a lot more tests, a lot more emphasis. The frameworks also made it a lot easier to, you know, test. So we have a ton of unit tests and nothing gets through the pull request without tests. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> So then around 2012, I think Paul is the CEO. He leaves around the start of 2012. How was that?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I mean, I guess like, like any startup, like, you know, when there's product traction, a company's growing, everyone has their opinions and everyone has probably a slightly different opinion of what the product should be, how the product should be. And I guess they had their own different visions of how the product should be and things didn't pan out and I guess he just chose his path moving forward, but it was more like they couldn't agree on a single path or something.</p>
<p>So, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> How did that affect you and the team?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Not a lot of people got to interact with Paul at the time. It was mostly a very few set of individuals who joined early on. Things were going great as a business so it was easy comparitively, but it was like a little bit of question mark, like what's going on who's going to make some calls and stuff.</p>
<p>It was a small period of transition that any company goes through. So we were able to hire faster and quickly figured out a way like who's going to do what and how are we going to move forward as a team?</p>
<p>Didn't take much time, Bessemer they were onboard to help us. So, yeah, it went fine. The company continued to grow and kept out growing the pace of all the imaginations and stuff. So, yeah, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And for a long time, Pinterest was invite only how long did that last and did you have a date or some kind of set criteria to ungate it </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I think the funny story here is Ben is a serial entrepreneur. He was building products and for a long time, I think this is my version of the story I don't know if it's the 100% true story, but for a long time he built products and he just didn't pick a date to launch or probably just too scared to launch.</p>
<p>So the product was always behind an invite only feature, just like, okay, we're just trying to get some feedback, you know, we're learning, we want to make it better and then one day we're just going to come out with a bang sort of attitude. So we gave every user like three or five invites and the product was carefully crafted with a message that, Hey, invite people only that you care about&quot; or you know that someone has a great taste in something and you want to explore that taste on this visual product, try it out.</p>
<p>So the messaging was pretty precise and we grew that way. And that growth itself was pretty crazy at the time that we just didn't even have to open the doors. And that kept the quality control also at a very high bar. And then slowly as people were running out of invites, we were just replenishing them.</p>
<p>All right. I think you invited five great set of folks. here's five more invites. that itself was giving us a lot of growth that we didn't really go out and say, like we'll open the door and also it became a very enticing factor for the product at that point of time. And then at some point, I guess probably 2012, I don't really remember, but at some point I'm like, all right, it doesn't make sense anymore we're big, Google indexed a ton of webpages from our product and you Google it, Pinterest is showing up. It doesn't make any more sense to be invite only. We got to go out there and grow at a faster rate. And then we removed that, I think, as a part of a, an Android and an iOS app launch, I think. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, you mentioned Google indexing the search results. That seems to be kind of controversial among some parts of the internet. How did you deal with any of the backlash from that?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I think the backlash came much, much later. A point of time in 2016 or 15, where the image search results were totally taken over by Pinterest results. as I said, the growth team ran a lot of experiments and they were learning structuring the page this way is giving us this result compared to this.</p>
<p>It was long years of effort that put us in a position to actually target the SEO in a very precise manner. And at some point, Pinterest results were taking over the entire Google image search. I guess a few sets of people who are not happy because they wanted to see more results across the web, not just one product or a subset of people's opinion on a search string. it was good for the company, but maybe not for the entire search ecosystem. But Google made a lot of refinements over time that toned it down And made it more neutral. But we had a lot of humans crawling the internet indexing stuff for us on Pinterest, which is a great candidate for a search product.</p>
<p>I think it naturally took over the Google ecosystem or the Google image search, but I guess they adjusted the algorithm to make it more neutral, but it was a great source of growth for Pinterest at that time.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And yeah, you talked about the kind of growth engineering or growth hacking there. What do you think were like one of the most elegant growth hacks that Pinterest did?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I think early on in 2011, when the FriendFeed acquisition was completed by Facebook, they were building the open graph API where every user could push a lot of data like, oh Yash is listening this music on Spotify. He checked in, in Foursquare everything. So the API was much more open where we were pushing a ton of content into the open graph.</p>
<p>So people would see a lot of content like, oh, this is someone painting this stuff on Pinterest. Someone liked the stuff on Pinterest. Someone commented this stuff on Pinterest. So we were leveraging Facebook's open graph API and pushing a ton of stuff, which I think is the foray into our growth hacks, like leveraging that API and over time, Facebook really clamped down the access of that API. But by that time, Pinterest was a very widely recognized product on the Facebook ecosystem. And I think that was the first foray into growth hacking. And then as I said, we were delivering webpages just for the search bots, like Google, Bing, and everything. We were giving a very huge flat page with a lot of results and a lot of links intertwined in the product, which was very rich for the search bots. And also that helped scale to take over the Google search results. I think that would be the second one. </p>
<p>And a lot of these kinds of hacks really pushed us into the 10 X envelope. Like we were growing at a very fast rate. We were doubling every 45 days every month and half for the first two years, which was pretty crazy. But I think those are the two prominent hacks I can think of. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> That's super cool. With that doubling, there's also growth of the team itself. I would love to hear how you navigated that and, how I suppose your job changed and Pinterest changed as you got bigger. So I think there was like five times more engineers from 2011 to 2012, and then five times again from 2012 to 2013.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I guess I knew a whole lot about the backend initially. So as the site was just blowing up I had to take a little bit of a leadership role in the back end infrastructure. Since I knew the most about the code at the same time we were interviewing and onboarding a lot of engineers who came in and, understood the state, like, okay, let's just focus on test driven development and write a whole lot of tests.</p>
<p>And while we were, you know, trying to rewrite a lot of the search infrastructure or trying to rewrite a lot of the database infrastructure, because the amount of data coming into the product, as I said, was doubling every few days. So we had to do a lot of database partitioning, which we thought we were going to accomplish in probably two months, but took like eight months just like any software project.</p>
<p>And during this time we were interviewing and onboarding people on the product while trying to rewrite a lot of the core services and stuff. And we hired pretty amazing Amazon, Facebook individuals who brought their experience and came and helped me grow the team, put in engineering manager.</p>
<p>I realized I didn't want to get into people management. I enjoyed coding, I enjoy engineering and building products. So I stayed in the tech lead role and like, you know, I need that for being on call and setting up those rotations, everything. While folks came in, managed individuals, hired a PM and communicated what are the changes and how should the product evolve for the next six months?</p>
<p Because we're going to change a lot of the core. So why don't you guys focus on this? And once we get the stuff done, we can build a product on top of it. So a lot of communication, I understood as the org is growing, there's so many people that we need to communicate the changes to, like, you know, set deadlines, match those deadlines and work across teams, search infrastructure, core, everything.</p>
<p>So I just had to grow into a little bit of a people skill and also at the same time, lead a bunch of engineers to, get to a certain state, which I didn't really enjoy, frankly. I, I enjoy like, you know, building smaller things and pushing and learning. So that was an evolution over the later half of my Pinterest journey that like, okay. I guess as the processes kick in and like there's a lot of people involved. I think I, I don't enjoy that a whole lot. So I, I learned a lot about myself, like, okay. I think I'm a good hacker who just wants to get things off the ground. But yeah, that, that would be the brief version, but happy to dive into any specific </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, that's super interesting. I suppose that kind of leads into maybe you're a rebirth, which I found super interesting when I came across it. You basically, handed in your laptop, got a new laptop, we re like a new employee and started on mobile development instead. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Doing that role as like core and backend guy and, you know, the new engineers were on board. They were writing code, they're pushing code. And like we put other people on call and a lot of funny stories where like your site goes down at 2:00 AM in the morning and they really don't know where the trouble is.</p>
<p>And anyway, sometimes I get pinged and I have to wake up and like fix things and get some sleep and come back. At some point, it gets tiring and we were onboarding people, but not fast enough. So I think after the first four years, I just got tired of backend core infrastructure work </p>
<p>The team got pretty big and like it's in a good shape. So I took that time to rethink, what should I be doing next? should I figure out this people management skills thing? Or should I go build something new or should I learn something new? I guess once again, Ben was extremely helpful.</p>
<p>Like, Hey, I think you're a great product engineer. You need to move a little bit closer to the product. And that's when I I took a little bit of time off, you know, got back fresh and like, yeah, took a brand new laptop, joined a new team, almost like a new employee. So, as you said, like kind of a rebirth inside Pinterest I started learning iOS and the client side, very different set of engineering skills.</p>
<p>I spent 80% of my time in backend thinking about concurrency and throughput, scalability and everything compared to 80% of my time on the client was just polishing the pixels and like, oh, is this interaction right? Does this flow seem right to me? Should I get more feedback from designers?</p>
<p>So I worked very closely with a lot of designers and I understood, okay the stuff I did back in the day, I'm doing it again but at a much grander scale with a big design team, with a very few set of engineers, literally working together. So building a product with like probably 20 folks. It was a very different experience, I learned a lot in the first two years. I learned a lot about the iOS and the client side programming as well. But again, yeah, end of that two years and like, okay, what's the next thing I need to figure it out.</p>
<p> I started a new team called emerging products, worked with one designer, one backend person, and one me as a clientside programmer. Started prototyping a lot of things inside Pinterest, like, let's take Pinterest search and try to think it through for the new generation, the new kind of data, new kind of verticals and stuff. So a lot of prototyping. Six of us flew to Portland to think about people are sharing pins out of Pinterest, what about we build a conversation product inside Pinterest, and that became the messages platform where you can share a pin, have a conversation about it. And then again change the context and stuff. So a lot of interesting ideas became products and features and continue to evolve.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> It seems there's always this desire to get back to the original kind of maker and hacker state, and I suppose that brings us to MakersPlace itself. So what was leaving Pinterest like? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> It was very emotional. I always treated Pinterest like, like a baby that, you know, we nurtured and it was, it was hard emotions. But as I said, I was prototyping a lot of products and features and as the team grew a lot, shipping something becomes extremely hard, you know, deadlines, priorities, and PR is a whole lot of stuff that we have to deal with. So I felt like, okay, I think I want to ship something because we're building a lot, but not really shipping and shipping at that scale requires a whole lot of things, which I completely understand Ben's perspective and the company's perspective. </p>
<p>So I think end of 2017, almost like for 2017, I was pretty checked out and not in a great mindset. Like I wanted to work on new things, but my immigration was extremely slow. A bunch of mistakes were made, so my case was stuck. So I got stuck for a good amount of time in the last year of Pinterest. And I wanted to really work on something new. So it's a little bit of hard time, but luckily I have good set of people always watching for me, they helped me out. </p>
<p>End of 2017 I left Pinterest and I didn't know what to do, but I was pretty fascinated about things that were happening, one of them being the Bitcoin whitepaper. I'd read about it, and was like, this is fascinating. It's an interesting technology. And also my co-founder Dannie who headed the growth team at Pinterest. He left Pinterest around the same time and we have a lot of common friends who were saying that you guys are literally talking the same lingo and the same set of ideas, just in a different filter or a different lens. So a lot of people told, like, we, we both should connect and talk about it. And we started connecting and hanging out and talking about a lot of ideas, and then within no time, we started working together in 2018 March. And then we were just like trying to understand Ethereum, write some code, and before we know it, we had something we wanted to ship. The idea also came for MakersPlace almost from both our experiences fused into one product where we felt Pinterest is such a great product for curators who are curating stuff on the internet. Like, oh, I like these hundred recipes. This defines me and my taste in food and this one board defines my taste in photography, like film or back and white or portraits or whatever.</p>
<p>So everything is great but the people who are really creating the content on the internet are not able to make money. Neither that they're getting the attribution that they deserve because content is stolen every single day. Like I shared a link, someone reblogs it on their Tumblr and then the source is detached from the content, and there's no way for us to attribute who's the original creator. I think a lot of these efforts happened inside Pinterest as part of the rich pins team and whatnot. But it's just a hard problem because internet was defined to be a free-flowing tube where information just flows and it doesn't often have a context attached to the content. So we felt we need to build something where this context is stuck to the content so that we know exactly who created it and who owns the IP and how can I rent the IP, or make a deal on top of this IP. So I think a lot of these abstract questions were the same things we were just dabbling about, and we felt I think this Bitcoin thing is pretty fascinating and maybe we can fuse this immutable database, called the blockchain and this content and the attribution into one certificate. And I think that idea put us on this journey, called MakersPlace, where we're working with digital creators to bring the digital content and fingerprint the hash of that content on the blockchain so that we know who created what and who owns what. I think that was how we got started.</p>
<p>I know NFTs is like a big thing now, but back in the day that pushed us on this trajectory where we discovered the NFT spec and luckily we built to the spec and we're today we are an NFT company focused on selling digital art, one of a kind and very rare. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> When was the spec released actually, the NFT spec you just mentioned?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I think, I think the spec was probably right before 1.0 in end of 2018. And we built a like on the ERC721 spec, right before it hit its final thing. So our contract was not 100% compliant, but about 98% compliant. But yeah, end of 2018. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> I think that's probably another case of being in the right place at the right time doing the right things. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yet again, yes.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> I only heard about NFTs this year, along with probably the vast majority of people who have heard about them. Say most people still have not. Although most people listening to this probably will have.</p>
<p>But yeah, I suppose, during that time from 2018 up till now, I think Pinterest IPOed in 2019. How did that feel from the outside? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Oh, it was, it was a great moment. Unfortunately, I wasn't here in America at the time. I was in India. It was, it was like such a great moment for me personally, that I just, I wish I was in New York with the team celebrating and extremely proud of the team, what they achieved, and yeah. I mean, I can't put into words, but my wife says like, you know, I had, I almost had tears in my eyes and, but I, I just missed being with the team at that point, but yeah </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> For context, when you left, I think the last round was valued at like 12.3 billion, so you probably knew you were in safe hands anyway, but good, good to see it recognized w which, which to, to kind of put some figures on it, the first raise just before you joined was valued at around 2.2 million.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I have no idea, frankly. I, I didn't even know I had equity in the company. I'm going to be really honest. I just took the job because I thought it was a great opportunity to learn and probably I started in 2010 Jan or Feb first and around mid 2011 that's when I got some paperwork like, oh, by the way you get some equity in shares. oh, oh, that's cool. Oh, where do I need to sign it? I didn't even know the numbers. I didn't, I didn't even know a whole lot of deal at the time. I just signed whatever I could. And then we kept moving, but I learned a lot about all of this stuff, probably somewhere in the mid journey at Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> That worked out pretty well anyway. It could have been awkward if you were interviewing people and they start asking for equity and, </p>
<p>uh, he really, </p>
<p>you guys are getting equity? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah, no, I, as I said, like good set of folks. Yeah. I didn't know a lot, but, I learned along the journey. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> So then at MakersPlace how did you guys go about your first hire?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> So we're three co-founders me, Dannie and Ryoma. Dannie and Ryoma went to college together. So for a long time, it was just three of us. I was coding the backend, Dannie was building the product and doing front end and Ryoma was going and talking with a lot of creators and trying to help them understand what is it about how is supply and demand or extremely rare digital artwork. It's only one of one. And people would be like, why is it one-on-one, isn't it digital? What can't I just get the file, blah, blah, blah. There was a ton of education that we had to do and an uphill battle. And most of these conversations go way about the head. When we use the word blockchain, people are just like alright we're out, we don't get it. So for probably more than a year, it was just three of us, and then we made a first hire, which is Anne Marie, she's a community member. So she was taking care of Discord doing clubhouses. yeah, so we used to conduct clubhouses, introduce NFT artists to the collectors where the collectors used to come ask a lot of interesting questions, like what made you go into this crypto, our journey? How do you see yourself? what is the theme behind this certain drop or a piece, and where do you go from here? So a lot of interesting questions where the collectors got to know about a set of great creators and they became diehard fans and they keep collecting. So slowly, all those things evolve.</p>
<p>So that was the first hire. Then we hired an engineer and then we started growing the community. And over Discord, we moved to Twitter spaces, but I think every drop, when we are introducing an artist, we give the community an opportunity to come interact with artists, like a real world art gallery, where the artist talks about his craft and why and the what.</p>
<p>But yeah it was pretty organic. What was happening in the physical world, in the physical art world, all of that was coming into the native digital art world. I guess the pandemic also accelerated this movement. Everything being shut down and people still want to do stuff and Decentraland was an amazing place where we put up a MakersPlace art gallery and people would come visit the Decentraland virtual land where there's a virtual art gallery and the voiceover of the artist, José Delbo was probably the most prominent one that I remember being the first one. He drew the first Batman, Wonder Woman and a lot of characters for the comics. And he'd come into the space and like, you know, sharing his initial works and taking those initial works with the help of other artists and bringing it to life with some animation stuff was pretty fascinating. The community reacted extremely well. We learned a lot and it became the drop program that we kind of legitimized in the space today.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> You mentioned taking some stuff from the real art world and getting that online. How do you think about, say the analogies between say web one being, just getting real world stuff online. So, you know, getting catalogs online, I mean, that was initially totes idea, right?</p>
<p>And that didn't really work out. So web one was just taking things in the real world, putting them online and maybe some early NFTs and still some today, I mean, there's still a good mix are maybe just traditional digital artworks that are now NFTs, but then you have say someone like Pak which is a lot more involved or maybe native crypto, kind of NFTs. How do you think about that and how that's going to progress over time?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I think crossing that physical into the digital barrier is one of the biggest jumps that an individual has to make. The different points or different moments that I saw an individual make that jump and really get this concept. I personally, and also for Makerspace, we tried a lot of ideas, like, working with a digital frame company to every time you buy a piece on MakersPlace, the piece should automatically show up in your screen or in your digital frame.</p>
<p>And we felt like that might be a good bridge for someone to come from a physical world and really understand this new evolving market. It just didn't pan out. Shipping hardware is extremely hard and also COVID put us in a situation that like, we can't do a whole lot. So every time we did these real world art shows, we always leveraged iPads. And for bigger ones, we use the bigger premium frames.</p>
<p> That helped a few people like really understand, but at the same time, like, well, what happens if someone else gets the file. you go to Twitter people consistently talk about right click save and why buy when I can right click and save pieces. It still is. It is still a fascinating question. Like that is very true, but I guess education is like, it's about the ownership and the ownership is out in the open and that is what matters and not owning the JPEG. So a lot of fascinating ideas, but I guess my take here is buying an NFT is about getting into a limited size group or your ticket to an exclusive club. I think that is what most people in this journey are coming to the realization like, oh, I want an Ape, because an Ape is about getting to this access to this limited edition club and a lot of people visualize or picturize this entire NFT movement in a lot of different ways. Some people do it for, oh, I want to buy it for less and sell it for more. It's like stocks is old and like cryptocurrency is the new one. And like cryptocurrency, the ICO's are all fading out because it's been two, three years. And now the next thing is okay, buying the new set of NFTs and getting in early and then, you know, hodling them and then selling.</p>
<p>So a lot of people do it for different reasons. I just buy it because one I like the artists, I like the journey and I want to support them. And I think Patreon and a bunch of these models are not the best ways to support an artist compared to buying an early piece and showing your fandom. I think that's one way to do it. That's why I've never sold an NFT so far, but I've always been buying some good artists that I respect on MakersPlace and also elsewhere. That's my opinion. I don't know if I covered all of it, but I'm just curious. what do you think? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> I still think we're in very early days here. I mean, you definitely know a lot more about this than I do. But yeah, how do you see MakersPlace evolving from, or do you see it evolving from just art? I think you said previously that you're starting with art, but an NFT doesn't have to be an artwork. It can be a song or a ticket, or do you think you'll venture into that or?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Absolutely. I think we have definitely done some experiments. So we worked with Shakira on dropping some of her works with the prominent artist, Bosslogic. So some of her funny vocals mixed with a very prominent artist's backgrounds and 3d modeling. I think that was a great experiment. We believe music is a big foray into NFTs. We raised money from Sony music so that we can leverage the upcoming artists and work with them in the future to shape the NFT use of music.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Hmm. I mean Eminem got in in your series A as well, right? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Yeah, yep. There's some great stuff that we are brainstorming together. It'll take some time, but we definitely have some good ideas that we wanna work on. Eminem got in, Sony music. We worked with Patrick Mahomes early this year to drop a bunch of his NFTs that will be part of his hall of fame museum of Mahomes, where he wants to create it in a virtual world at some point. Those were some first set of exclusive pieces, which I think we've done some fascinating experiments. We need to find individual leaders inside the company to take those things and make it a vertical that we cared about. So we need, we are definitely trying to step out of the only, the digital art space and also go into the entire NFT space and see what's possible for sure.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And how would you say you differentiate yourself from some of the other platforms?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> It's a good question. I think initially when we built a product with web3, MetaMask and all this stuff, we felt like, oh, it's so hard. Like I need to buy some Ether, put it into the MetaMask, take a backup of the mnemonic words. A lot of artists lost their mnemonic words and we're like, yeah, sorry, your game's over, just restart. So when we built the product, we felt the pain. So we started building a custodial solution like Coinbase. So when you onboard on MakersPlace today, you have an option to bring your own wallet or use a MakersPlace custodial wallet. Using a MakersPlace custodial wallet gives you a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p>One, we can do credit card transactions, lock the market price of Ethereum, and then facilitate the credit card transaction, move the token into a MakersPlace issued custodial wallet. So you don't need to know anything about crypto. You can get in, buy an NFT and hold it. I think that's one of our biggest differentiating factors in the early years, I guess everyone's slowly trying to facilitate. </p>
<p>We do a drop program where one, we are a curated place. So an artist cannot just hop on MakersPlace until they're invited. So we validate the portfolio, we talk to them, we set them up and then we verify their identity and make sure they are the artists that they claim to be. So as a buyer, if you buy a piece it's 100% guaranteed to be a legitimate piece, there's no chance that someone's scamming you and trying to sell an artwork that they didn't create.</p>
<p>We take that stuff extremely seriously. So we're a curated place caring about the end user experience, removing all the complexities of blockchain and making it super simple to use. Also we add that curation level. We bring the Pinterest experience. So we get the follow model.</p>
<p>You have a feed of all the creators that you love and follow, and you can, subscribe to those updates and stuff. And also you get drop updates. If your favourite artist is dropping some specific theme-based artworks, you get to be notified. Yeah, I think it's all about the community. So we have a very strongly knit community on Discord that we engage in conversations.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Do you think you'll ever take away that gated permission? I mean you know, Pinterest used to be invite only. Is there a stage in MakersPlace's future for that?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I think we might relax constraints and lower the barrier of entry, but I guess that curation is what differentiates us. And so far, no plans of removing it, but we are definitely actively working on trying to reduce the friction to get on, to MakersPlace. Right now, it's, it's a pretty intricate process there. We have to review the portfolio, get to talk to the artist, onboard them, but yeah, we have a team to reduce the friction there. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah. So I suppose in the same year as Pinterest IPOed, you got your first round of fundraising, the seed round for 2 million from Uncork as the lead investor. They only invest in <a href="https://uncorkcapital.com/companies/">incredible companies</a>, so that's nice. And then in was it March of this year you had the Beeple. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Beeple sale </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, so how did that come about? So this is the largest NFT sale ever for $69.3 million. Whose idea was that?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> If you rewind a year back from March 2021, Ryoma was trying to onboard Beeple onto MakersPlace and Beeple being a very prominent artist's like, oh, I think I need a kind of like a bang moment to really step in and so he wanted a big, a moment to come in and bring his artworks and Ryoma was talking to Christie's around that time, like trying to educate them and try to teach them like why they need to pay attention to the space. So a lot of informational exchange calls like, oh, this is how owning an NFT means. You need a wallet, you need security phrases and they're like what? Okay. I guess if we sell an NFT who does what, and what does that deal mean? Both sides of the table. So a lot of educational material going back and forth you know, having some time to think about it. </p>
<p>Around December 2020, finally Christie's was onboard. Like, all right, let's just do it. Can you think of anyone? Who's a great poster child for this NFT thing that you want to nurture. And we had a few artists in mind and Beeple was one of them and Ryoma started talking to Beeple and pitch like, Hey, we have a possibility to work with Christies. But we need to make it big.</p>
<p>So we'll have to come up with a plan, a design plan and stuff. So like, okay. He's, here's all my artwork, should I hand pick a few? And so the conversations were going back and forth and Ryoma was just like, all right, I think it's going to happen but how about we put everything, everything into one picture, if you can fit it.</p>
<p>So Beeple came up with a big 21,000 by 21,000 pixel image with all his 5,000 everydays in it. And we put it on auction in Christie's and it was probably in one of those lots. Like probably 150th lot Beeple, one by one, 5,000 everydays up for auction and like, no action, but like, okay, there's a little bit of money. All right. I mean, it's up for 21 days or something, and we were keeping an eye, but like, no action was happening. All the action happened, probably like two hours before the end time of the auction. Justin Sun and MetaKovan we're literally going like bang, bang. And I guess at the hammer time, like MetaKovan was on the top.</p>
<p>I did hear that Justin was going to counter and outbid him, but I guess the time was up. But it was, it was a fascinating time. But that's how the auction happened, and became a big deal. And we facilitated the deal with Christie's didn't know, when Christies got the money and they were like, oh, we have this, all this money in Ether what do we do? How do we do this payment and everything? And we handled their, all the splits and everything, and we closed the deal. As you said like, yeah, it defines NFT. Everything on the site was going crazy. Like ton of traffic, site was going down. Beeple did giveaways where he was selling hand-picked seven pieces out of his 5,000 everydays.</p>
<p>And he wanted to give it away as a thank you to the community. People were just coming on the site and clicking, like to get into that to buy those $1 $7 pieces and the site was barely staying up. So kind of fun times yet stressful too. So yeah, that's how it all went down.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, that's a super cool story. I think I've been following Beeple for years back from the Tumblr days. And he's one of those people that just ends up in your feed and you're not sure if you were ever not following them But then yeah, seeing just that commitment, like producing art every day and eventually having some pay off it's super exciting and I suppose speaks well to NFTs.</p>
<p>Like I've enjoyed a lot of his stuff for a long time and it's good to see artists actually being able to both make money on the internet, but also have more control of stuff, and obviously there's a lot of interesting mechanics and things people can build in there. I suppose another similar one is Pak. If anyone's ever followed Archillect on Twitter just this kind of algorithmic, nice photos.</p>
<p>Again, I'd been following him for ages and then just seeing the transition to NFTs. I think his work is really well-placed for that. But I think now he's kind of what I mentioned earlier, he's gone full native crypto in that, he's not just selling like GIFs or JPEGs. He's got a whole experience around that. How do you help facilitate that and those kinds of transactions and how do you think you can do that going forward?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I can share one story. Like we worked with Pak on a specific project called the creation. It is that the creation piece where like you remember the iconic piece, right? So he basically recreated the piece and he wanted to sell tiles of that. I think it was 580 tiles. So when he came with that concept and like the entire thing was custom, right? So we had to write code just for Pak's drop. So you buy a tile and the next tile shoots up in value by 2x and then the next six or eight tiles stay 2x and immediately after a window, again, it shoots up by 2x.</p>
<p>So opening the entire artwork is going to cost a lot of money and people choose like, oh, I want to unlock this tile. So it was a fascinating idea. When we recognized, oh, that's a fantastic idea we were able to turn the entire thing in like two weeks, like, Hey, here's a prototype that works, and I think we can solidify and put it in production in probably 10 days, and we did that and it worked extremely well. And so when we hear a great idea, we tend to jump on it and make it happen. But I think we, we were fostering a team and Ryoma personally, you know, connects with a lot of creators, collects their ideas and like comes back to us and like, Hey, here's what this artist wants, do you think we can do it?</p>
<p> When the team was smaller, it was much easier. But now, when things are at a certain scale, like not making changes is extremely hard but we're always y'know open for ideas and willing to work and make it happen. So that was one story. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Yeah, I think Pak was singing your praises for your work with him on that on Twitter, a good testament to the platform and the team. </p>
<p>Any plans for Solana NFTs anytime soon?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> Ugh, we've been thinking about multi chain for a while. I think our biggest question is as a collector, if I buy something on Ethereum or Solana or Polygon or anything as a collector, I should be able to decide, I bought this hundred thousand dollar token on Solana or Matic, which is not the best chain. And I personally think that might put people in a position to de-value the artwork because, oh, it's not an Ethereum. It's not on the best blockchain out there and stuff. So we've been experimenting and talk to a lot of these bridges. The token bridge is where as a collector, I should be able to move a token from Matic into Ethereum, just because I think like, oh, this is going to appreciate so much and I'm going to market a lot about this.</p>
<p>So unless, and until the token bridges realize and work efficiently in terms of gas and reliable device we're not making any calls on being multi chain, but I personally am reading a lot about Solana, and the SPL, and the Anchor framework, and it's pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I don't have to learn a specific language for Solana, but I think Solana is going to change a lot of this game and personally I'm paying close attention, but yeah, MakersPlace wise, I think we're gonna wait and see this ecosystem mature a little bit in terms of these bridges? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> So you previously said you would recommend everyone work at an early stage startup at least once, but no more than that. Do you still agree? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> I think so, yeah. It's a pretty different experience working at a bigger company and having things and processes set in stone and it's about, you know, navigating this way. So the journey is much more clear, stable, you budget in time, well ahead of time and you really test for perfection compared to like a scrappy startup where it's completely opposite. We don't have the luxury of time. We just got to throw things out and you have to see what sticks on the wall.</p>
<p>And then on that, we start building things and as things progress, then the processes come in and so I think going through that experience it will change you as an engineer and also as an individual. That's why I highly recommend like y'know anyone just like you got to work in a smaller company to get a feel for it and then I guess you will appreciate both the worlds for its merits or advantages. But whatever fits the individual, they got to do yeah what suits. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And the only once I presume you've negated that already.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> If you give it, and give it all, I hope you, you only go through it once and then it should be just like, all right, I am good. I just want to be in a much more stable environment. But yeah, that's what I meant. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> Okay. I think that's a perfect note to leave it on. Thanks for the time.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#C45252">Yash:</strong> No, thank you!</p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Oisín:</strong> And thank you, dear listener for getting this far. In a startup, customer feedback is one of the most valuable resources, so if you have any feedback, positive or negative, I would be eternally grateful if you could share it.
